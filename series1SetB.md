# **Part A**

## **1.Explain about the applications of client-server computing.**

- **File Sharing:** Enables sharing files across a network.
- **Email Services:** Manages sending, receiving, and organizing emails.
- **Web Hosting:** Hosts websites and delivers web content.
- **Database Management:** Manages and accesses databases for data storage.
- **Remote Access:** Allows remote access to resources and applications.
- **Print Serving:** Manages printing tasks and printer access.
- **Collaborative Tools:** Supports real-time collaboration and file sharing.
- **Online Gaming:** Facilitates multiplayer gaming experiences.

## **2. Discuss various protection methods for the physical security holes**.

Protection methods for physical security holes:

1. **Password Policies:** Enforce strong passwords and regular changes.
  
2. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):** Require multiple verification methods.
  
3. **Access Control Systems:** Use keycards, biometrics, or PIN codes for entry.
  
4. **Security Awareness Training:** Educate users about password security.
  
5. **Encryption:** Secure sensitive data with encryption.
  
6. **Physical Security Measures:** Lock server rooms and install security cameras.
  
7. **Regular Audits:** Monitor user accounts and access logs regularly.
  
8. **Penetration Testing:** Test for vulnerabilities and fix them promptly.


## **3. State how Client/Server developed applications may achieve substantially greater performance when compared with traditional workstations**

1. **Distributed Processing:** Tasks split between clients and servers for faster execution.
  
2. **High-Performance Servers:** Powerful hardware enhances application speed.
  
3. **Optimized Networking:** Efficient protocols minimize latency and maximize data transfer.
  
4. **Scalability:** Easily handle increased demand by adding servers or upgrading hardware.
  
5. **Parallel Processing:** Concurrent task execution boosts overall throughput.
  
6. **Load Balancing:** Distribute workload evenly to prevent performance bottlenecks.
  
7. **Caching:** Store frequently used data locally for quicker access and reduced server load.


## **4.Explain about three-tier computing.**

Three-tier computing involves dividing an application into three separate logical layers:
  
1. **Presentation Tier:** Handles user interaction and interface display.
  
2. **Logic Tier:** Contains business logic and processing algorithms.
  
3. **Data Tier:** Stores and retrieves information from databases or other data sources.


## **5.Define Fat Clients and Fat servers**

- **Fat Clients:**
  - Conducts minimal processing on the client side.
  - Places more application functionality on client machines.
  - Often used in traditional Client/Server models.
  - Can pose maintenance challenges for Client/Server systems.

- **Fat Servers:**
  - Conducts more processing on the server side.
  - Provides higher-level services.
  - Current trend favors fat servers in Client/Server Systems.
  - Easier to manage as only server software needs updates.
