| Scalable for large-scale deployments. | Ensures data integrity across multiple transactions. |
| Enables easier load balancing. | Allows for customized client experiences. |


## **9.Discuss the principles behind the Client/Server system**
**Principles Behind Client/Server Systems:**

Client/Server systems follow important rules to make sure they work well. These rules are like the foundation of a building, making sure everything fits together correctly:

1. **Hardware Independence**:
   - Everything in the system should work on different types of computers without any problems.

2. **Software Independence**:
   - The system should be able to work with different types of software and systems, making it flexible and able to work with other programs.

3. **Open Access to Services**:
   - Every part of the system should be easy to access from anywhere on the network, and users should be able to get the services they need whenever they need them.

4. **Process Distribution**:
   - Tasks should be split up between clients and servers in a smart way:
   - Clients and servers have their own jobs to do, making the system organized.
   - The system should be able to grow and change easily to handle more work or use better technology.


5. **Standards**:
   - All parts of the system should follow the same set of rules:
   - Even if different rules can be used, they all need to work together without causing problems.
   - Following these rules makes sure everything works together well and gets the job done right.

These rules make sure that Client/Server systems are strong, flexible, and can work well with other systems, making them very useful in today's world of computers.
